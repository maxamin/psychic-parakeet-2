        We have a single message m, that was encrpted, using RSA, and sent to three people.
        All reciepents have the same RSA ecryption modulas e (e=3), (notice it also matches the no. of recipients ;) ).  
        We are interested in the message. 

        Your Objective : Reveal the originial message
