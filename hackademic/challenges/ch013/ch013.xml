        Our adversaries use a primitive and insecure mode of operation to obtain Message Authentication Codes for communication. While they use a secure block cipher, F, to obtain MACs for one block, when it comes to multiple blocks their scheme can be easily manupulted and broken. 

        Your Objective : Help us forge a valid MAC to confuse them.
