        You are given ciphertexts of various messages, encrypted with the same key using a XOR Cipher or Vernam or One Time Pad. 

        However we know the OTP is secure for encrypting only one message. And we are confident it is possible to break the scheme now. 

        Given a set of ciphertexts, we are interested in knowing only one. 
 
		Your Objective: Decipher the asked ciphertext and suggest us a strategy for action.
