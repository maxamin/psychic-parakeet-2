        We have a message m, for which we want a valid signature. While we have access to a Sign Oracle to query signatures, it will not respond and sign the challenge message for which we want the signature.
        Your Mission, should you choose to accept it, is to forge a signature on the challenge message, using the oracle (or otherwise).
