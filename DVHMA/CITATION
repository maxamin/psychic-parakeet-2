  abstract	= {Developing mobile applications is a challenging business:
		  developers need to support multiple platforms and, at the
		  same time, need to cope with limited resources, as the
		  revenue generated by an average app is rather small. This
		  results in an increasing use of cross-platform development
		  frameworks that allow developing an app once and offering
		  it on multiple mobile platforms such as Android, iOS, or
		  Windows.
		  
		  Apache Cordova is a popular framework for developing
		  multi-platform apps. Cordova combines HTML5 and JavaScript
		  with native application code. Combining web and native
		  technologies creates new security challenges as, e.g., an
		  XSS attacker becomes more powerful.
		  
		  In this paper, we present a novel approach for statically
		  analysing the foreign language calls. We evaluate our
		  approach by analysing the top Cordova apps from Google
		  Play. Moreover, we report on the current state of the
		  overall quality and security of Cordova apps. },
