Conventional methods of maintaining medical records have proven to be inadequate in several respects. A primary issue is the inherent lack of transparency in these processes. Paper-based records often suffer from issues related to authenticity, as verifying their accuracy can be challenging. Furthermore, these physical records are susceptible to corruption and unauthorized alterations. Additionally, the fragmentation of paper records complicates the task of maintaining a patient's comprehensive medical history.

The advent of Web3 technology, Decentralized Identifiers (DID), and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK-proof) technologies has ushered in a new era of enhanced security and privacy for digital documents, including medical records. Patients now have the ability to exert control over who can access their medical records, and healthcare providers can securely access the necessary information without compromising the privacy of their patients.
