This is the source code for the `escrin-runner` platform services and the
[@escrin/worker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@escrin/worker) TypeScript library.

### Developing

You can get started by installing `pnpm` and running `pnpm install`.

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the
[package scripts](https://github.com/escrin/escrin/blob/main/worker/package.json#L18). The important
ones are:

- `pnpm lint` - reports formatting errors and Solidity lints
- `pnpm format` - attempts to fix lints in-place
- `pnpm build` - builds the platform services and the TypeScript library
- `pnpm watch:build` - watches files and rebuilds them when they change

To run the platform services locally, compile [escrin/workerd](https://github.com/escrin/workerd)
and run `workerd serve --verbose config/local.capnp`.

To create a self-contained `escrin-runner`, use
`workerd compile config/local.capnp > escrin-runner`, which can then be run without additional
arguments (though `--verbose` is often helpful).

### Publishing

To publish this library, bump the version in `package.json`, push that change to `main`, and then
run `pnpm publish`.

## Points of Interest

- [src/index.ts](./src/index.ts) - the entrypoint of the
  [@escrin/worker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@escrin/worker) TypeScript library
- [workerd_config.capnp](./workerd_config.capnp) - the configuration of the `escrin/workerd` that
  runs the platform services and sets up the Smart Worker sandbox
- [src/runner.ts](./src/runner.ts) - the entrypoint service of the `escrin-runner` that spawns Smart
  Workers when requested
- [src/env/iam](./src/env/iam/) - a service linked to Smart Workers that provides decentrized key
  and identity management.
- [src/env/tpm](./src/env/tpm/) - a service that provides access to the local Trusted Platform
  Module, which can be used to remotely attest to relying parties
