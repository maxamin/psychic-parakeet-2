A Ruby on Rails (currently version 1.2.6) app with intentional flaws for use as a training tool.
Clone of Foundstone's Hacme Casino, hopefully for eventual merging with their official SVN version.
Intent is to bring the application up to date with latest Rails versions and practices to make it more useful for today's developers and testers.
